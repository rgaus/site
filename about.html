        Since I was a kid, I've always had a knack for building things. From
        my mom and I making a full size walking horse model for a play to
        designing &amp; building my own letterpress, I try to approach every
        problem with the respect it deserves.

        I grew up in the <em>Syracuse, NY</em> area - and that's always where home will be.
        After living there for most of my life, I spent the whole of 2022 travelling around
        the USA looking for what's next and settled on <em>Philadelphia, PA</em>. It's been great
        so far!

        I started writing software when I was in my early teens and through a series of
        serendipitous events, now work with a bunch of great people at
        <a href="https://bread.works" target="_blank">Bread</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">
        Before that, I worked at <a href="https://density.io" target="_blank">Density</a> - I was one of the first
        engineers hired in 2016 and 7 years later helped grow the
        business to a 1 billion dollar valuation. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-gaus-08068617b/" target="_blank">Read my LinkedIn</a>
