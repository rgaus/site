In late 2021, as I was finishing up the [letterpress]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2021-01-01-letterpress %}), I was looking for my next
project. Generally, I tend to look for disciplines that are technical, require learning new skills,
and which include lots of interesting and bespoke tools.

One thing which I've been meaning to learn more
about for years are sailboats. How they work is a complete mystery to me - I've heard though, by
taking advantage of the wind, a sailboat is able to move towards a destination in any direction!
I need to figure out how that works...

As part of this project, I'll have to teach myself about boat construction, sailmaking, rigging, and
at the very end, sailing. It's going to be quite an adventure, especially since I've never been on a
sailboat before and am sort of starting at zero.

## The Design

To begin, I need to decide exactly what kind of boat I want to make. There's a myriad of options,
all with their pros and cons. I've settled on a catamaran (a dual hulled boat) for two primary
reasons:

- First, catamarans are much more stable in the water than their monohulled counterparts.

- Secondly, I found a really great set of free plans!

Most boat plans you find online cost some money. That's not necessarily a problem, but, I really
want the ability to look them over before I commit to building something. After quite a bit of
research, I found a boatbuilder in Australia who managed to put together a pretty basic full size
catamaran, and he decided to put the plans out there for free.

<img class="mid" alt="Plan Image 1" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/plans1.png' | relative_url}}" />
<img class="mid" alt="Plan Image 2" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/plans2.png' | relative_url}}" />

These plans were featured in [an online publication called "The Coastal
Passage"](https://thecoastalpassage.com/papers/tcp75.pdf), and it contains a
series of pictures, some technical drawings, and a few descriptions.

It _seems_ pretty straightforward... let's give it a try!

## The Hulls

<img alt="Hull Parts" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/hullparts.png' | relative_url}}" />

Each hull is made up of a few different pieces:
- The **bulkheads** hold each hull into that typical "boat hull" shape. These are the bigger pieces
  of plywood in the image above.
- The **transoms** are each a "back plate" of one of the hulls. These help the hull taper at the back
  and provide a place to mount the rudders.
- The **sides** are the external faces of each hull. These are made out of cherry wood veneer - the
  same veneer I used when [making the floor in the model house]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2019-01-01-model-house %})!
- The **stringers** are long, thin reinforcing pieces. These help the side pieces form a nice,
  gradual curve around the bulkheads. These are made from basswood.

<br />
<img class="left" alt="Bending Stringers" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/bendngstringers.png' | relative_url}}" />

Each hull had a few interesting features - one of the more subtle was this curve at the base of the
back, right by where the transom will end up.

I was able to create this by slightly bending the stringer pieces - luckily, basswood is pretty flexible!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

After attaching all the veneer pieces, I could attach a keel to the bottom of each hull. These keels
are made of 1/8in baltic birch plywood.


## Attaching the hulls together

<img alt="Beams in between the hulls" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/beams.png' | relative_url}}" />

Between the hulls, I'll add some beams to hold them together. I cut these from 1/8in baltic birch
plywood.

Underneath the beams, I'll add a platform. This would typically be the base of the cabin, but in my
case, it's where all the mechanicals for my model will live.

## Waterproofing the hulls

As it is, my hulls are nowhere near waterproof. And, obviously, I need to make them waterproof for
them to float.

On a full size vessel, this is what fiberglass would be used for. But, fiberglass wouldn't really
work on the scale of a model. I've also never worked with it before, but I've heard it's quite nasty
stuff.

It turns out the model boat building community has a solution. They have a technique that involves
laying down a thin layer of laquer, followed by a layer of tissue paper. Repeating this over and
over results in a hard, waterproof shell.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
  <img style="width: 200px;" alt="Step 1: Veneer with Laquer" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/laquer1.png' | relative_url}}" />
  <img style="width: 200px;" alt="Step 2: Add Tissue Paper" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/laquer2.png' | relative_url}}" />
  <img style="width: 200px;" alt="Step 3: Final Finish" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/laquer3.png' | relative_url}}" />
</div>

My version of this didn't come out quite as nice and smooth as others seemed to indicate it would:

<img alt="My laquer finish" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/laquerme.png' | relative_url}}" />

But, I think it's fine. Crucially, it's waterproof. That's what matters.

## Controls

Throughout this project so far, I've been debating how exactly I would control this sailboat?
Without a way to adjust the sail angle or change the rudder direction, I'm going to have a hard time
getting anywhere.

<img alt="Radio Control Transmitter" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/rc.png' | relative_url}}" />

In the end, I decided to go radio control. I've never worked with RC equipment before, so, I got a
largely "ready to use" kit - [this
one](https://www.amazon.com/FLYSKY-Transmitter-Controller-Receiver-Upgrade/dp/B07Z8VCB45), if you
are curious. It comes with a transmitter and receiver already pre-paired, and should be pretty much
plug and play.  I'll be using servo motors throughout my model.

Speaking of things controlled by servos - it's time to start thinking about the rudder. Or, more
accurately: pair of rudders. This boat does have two hulls, after all. They are pretty simple bits
of construction, each being made up of three 1/8in plywood layers.

<img alt="Rudder" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/rudders.png' | relative_url}}" />

Each rudder attaches to the transom of one of the hulls. I came up with a sequence of linkages to
attach the two rudders together, and also attach them to a servo motor.

### Sail Angle

The other thing that I need to control with a servo is the sail angle. The angle of the sail is
critical to ensuring that the boat is moving in the correct direction and at the correct speed.

I had a few false starts with this mechanism - definitely watch the video if you'd like to know
more. But, the mechanism I ended up settling on is called a "sail arm".

<img alt="Sail Arm" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/sailarm.png' | relative_url}}" />

A servo is attached to a long arm. As the servo spins, the arm pulls on a line, which when attached
to the end of the beam, causes the sail to move back and forth.


## Sails

My model sailboat is going to be sloop rigged. I'm going for forego any sort of special sail for now
and only make a main sail. Anything more complicated I think is going to make my learning harder.

<img class="left" alt="Sail" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/sail.png' | relative_url}}" />

Generally, I've kept the design of this sail pretty simple, because I don't have access to a sewing
machine. I'm sort of going to be treating this crude sail as disposable. Once I get back home, I'm
going to try my hand at making a much better and much less crude sail with features like battens and
grommets.

My sail will be made of white ripstop nylon. I'm going to add some curve into the side of the sail
closest to the mast (the luff) to try to give it a more full shape. Why? Sail design is pretty
complicated, but I found [this blog post to be pretty
helpful](http://joecoopersailing.com/mast-bend-and-mainsail-shape/)
<br />
<br />

<img class="left" alt="Leech Line" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/leechline.png' | relative_url}}" />

I'm going to add one more feature - a leech line. This is a line that runs along the leading edge of
the sail to stiffen it.

In hindsight, I'm not sure how helpful this really was, but my thinking at the time was that because
I didn't have any battens, I wanted something to keep the edge of the sail from flopping all over
the place.

<br />
<br />

Finally, I need some holes I can use to attach the sail to the mast. On a bigger sails, grommets
seem to be the fastener of choice, but I had a hard time finding grommets small enough for this
sail.

<br />

<img class="left" alt="Sailboat Grommets - 'Button Holes'" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/grommet.png' | relative_url}}" />

So, here's what I did instead. I made a small hole in each corner of the sail. To ensure that it wouldn't
unravel, I took inspiration from a buttonhole on a pair of pants, and bound the raw edges with
thread.

And, that's about as far as I'm going to take the sail for now. I know, there's a lot I'm missing,
but, I'm hoping this will be enough to get me to my proof of concept stage.

## Assembly

After attaching all the parts together, rigging the sail, and doing a leak test - I think I'm done!

## Testing

<img class="left" alt="North Burial Ground" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/pond.png' | relative_url}}" />

While working on this project, [I've been travelling]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2021-12-29-my-big-trip %}), and when it came time to test the model, I was
in <strong>Providence, Rhode Island</strong>.

As I've been exploring the city, I've been keeping an eye out for where
I could test this thing.

My best option for a secluded, small body of water ended up being this
cemetery in the neighborhood called the "north burial ground". It had this small pond right in the
middle that seemed to get a decent breeze, so I figured it'd be a great place to test my model.

<img alt="Sailboat in the pond!" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/inpond.png' | relative_url}}" />

Once I got the sailboat in the water, it floated! After letting it sit there for a bit though, two
things became pretty clear:
- First, there wasn't nearly enough wind by the shore. I really needed to get my boat further out
  into the pond.
- Second, the little wind I was getting was pushing my sailboat sideways. The keels should stop
  this... so I guess I didn't make them big enough.

I figured I'd try pushing it out a little further... but, about the best tool I could cobble
together on short notice was a stick, and that was only so long.

I was able to include some really insightful timelapse shots in the video. I really was surprisingly
close to getting a positive result.  But, things were moving too slow out in the pond. And, I didn't
really have a great way to perform repeatable actions over and over, which is what I really need to
accomplish my objective of learning more about sailing.

## Testing... Again!

<img class="left" alt="Sailboat in the tub!" src="{{'/assets/img/posts/sailboat/intub.png' | relative_url}}" />

In the AirBnB that I'm staying in, I had a bathtub and a fan. So, I figured that might be a more
controlled location to do some experiments.

The video has a lot more details, but, I got much, much closer here than in the pond. If the bathtub
was just a little bit wider, I would have been able to complete my first jibe!

<br />

## Conclusion
I'm coming out of this project realizing that sailing is incredibly neat. I need to find a way to
get a way to get onto a real-life vessel soon. Luckily, I have a family member who has a sailboat.
I'm going to try to go sailing with him next year in 2022!
