My whole life, I've lived in Central New York.

It's not a bad place to grow up, and, for the last 5 years, I've lived in <strong>Downtown Syracuse,
NY</strong>. Syracuse has nice people, decent food, and a low cost of living. The tech community in
particular is amazing.  If it wasn't for them and all the events I've attended over the years, I
don't think I would have gotten into tech and eventually joined [Density](https://density.io). Also,
I am so lucky to be able to have and afford the storage unit that I've turned into my workshop. That
space has completely revolutionized what I can build, and has been a direct reason I've decided to
take on projects like the [model house](TODO) and [the letterpress](TODO).

But, as I'm starting to get into my mid 20s - I'm looking for something a bit larger, and, there are
a few attributes of Syracuse that have started to bug me. Syracuse is a very car-centric place. It's
possible to live downtown without a car, but, you're going to have to get a little creative
sometimes. Up until recently in fact, the closest grocery store was a 15 minute car ride away and
was inaccessible to pedestrians! The only public transit that Syracuse has to offer is a bus system
called Centro, which unfortunately has a pretty unremarkable service schedule. Syracuse also is not
a major urban center - the closest "big city" is New York City. Downtown Syracuse is about 10 blocks
by 10 blocks.

## "A Year of Travel"

A few years ago, I had this sort of grand plan - that 2020 would be a year of travel. I'd take a
bunch of trips to go visit potential places I'd like to live, and then at the end, decide where I'd
like to end up and make a big leap. So, in 2019, I began investigating new cities that I could one
day call home. My starting criteria:
1. **Bigger than Syracuse.** I decided to go with at least 200,000 people.
2. **Decent public transit and bike infrastructure.**
3. **Easy access to nature.** It can't take hours to get out of the urban center.
4. **Cost of living.** I am a frugal person, but renting an aparment shouldn't cost me multiple
   thousands per month. Also, I'd really like to have a workshop.
5. **Climate.** I don't like super hot summers or deserts. I can deal with cold weather, but I think
   the perfect place would have a more temperate climate.

I started out by taking every city that was at least 200,000 people or larger, and putting it
into a [big
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kV7AsFCDjFydH1lnEG5EaoxneeFZxpCC7MXK9NyqJU/edit?usp=sharing).

I added some demographc information from wikipedia for each city, as well as public transit
ridership figures and cost of living figures. I also added some more subjective columns. For cities
that sounded interesting, I did more research into them, trying to learn what I can about what they
have to offer.

And then, the COVID-19 pandemic really began. This sort of shut down all this planning. It was
unlikely I was going to travel anywhere new anytime soon.

## "A Year of Travel" - Part 2

Fast forward to summer 2021.

COVID-19 vaccines were now a thing. Generally, travel seemed like it was a bit more feasible, and, I
wanted to test the waters. I got on a plane for the first time in over a year and visited a place
that ended up ranking suprisingly highly in my spreadsheet: **Minneapolis, MN**. It was an amazing
trip, but what it really proved to me was that travelling safely was now very possible.

So, I decided that it was time to really make this thing happen. My downtown Syracuse apartment's
lease was up in a few months. I put together a short itinerary for the fall - I picked **New
England**. I'd start in Boston, move to Providence, then make a quick stop in New Haven before
finally ending up in New York City.

And, I can say now having completed that trip - It was amazing. I got a chance to see a wide range
of new urban environments. I built [a sailboat](TODO). I went to some world-class parks. I rode high
speed rail for the first time. I went to a few meetups and talked to some locals. I had my bike stolen.

## Leg 2

Anyway, I'm beginning to gear up for leg #2, which is going to be longer.

So far, here's my itinerary:

| City | Notes |
|-|
| Philladelphia, PA | |
| Austin, TX | |
| Albuquerque, NM | |
| San Diego, CA | I have a work-related event I plan to attend. |
| New York City, NY (again!) | With a stop back in Syracuse. |
| Minneapolis, MN (again!) | I need to see what minneapolis is like in the winter, with a bike. |
| Helena, MT | An old coworker / friend invited me to go skiing! |
| Spokane, WA |
| Seattle, WA |
